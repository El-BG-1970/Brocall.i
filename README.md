# Common Lisp Messenger

This project is intended to develop a messenging app in common lisp, and an effort to improve upon the [PGP---J-M](https://github.com/Philipp-Eisermann/PGP---J-M) project. One of the main goals of improvement is to use Object Oriented Programming to make the project much more modular.
